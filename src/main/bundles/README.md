Get an API key from polygon.io and put it into application.properties
Run via `mvn`
Find (some) stocks symbols you are interested in (either from the grid with filters view (which contains 1000 examples) or elsewhere). Go to the dashboard view, enter the symbol and quantity on the left and, once done, hit refresh on the right side. (The refresh button will be disabled for one minute after that due to API limitations).

Note: The application's goal is to be a proof of concept, it is not well-designed or implemented. The only goal was to get something somehow working as fast as possible (this includes LLM-assistence).
